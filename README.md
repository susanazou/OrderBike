Angular Front end, Java Sprint Boot with DB backend

The API is run on H2 In memory Db for now.  The src/resources/data.sql will create table and insert 2 records.  In order to run the app in IDE,  a manual step to create database may be needed first. 


ToDo:  
1. Create angular FE
2. Deploy to Azure
